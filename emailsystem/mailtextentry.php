    <p>Not sure what Penmen Pride points are? You have earned these points this past semester by attending on-campus events. At the end of the semester, all points are tallied and the top 300 students with the highest point amounts will receive prizes just for attending on-campus events! <b style="color: #152C59">The top 300 students will receive their prizes on Thursday, April 27th and Friday, April 28th.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #152C59;"><b><u>Prize Pickup will begin in the Student Center Lobby at 9 am on Thursday (4/27/17) until 3 pm and recommence at 9 am on Friday (4/28/17) until 3 pm.</u></b></p>
