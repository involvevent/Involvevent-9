    <p style="color: #152C59; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Dear Ryan,</b></p>
    <p style="color: #F3B329; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>So far, this semester YOU HAVE EARNED 85 PENMEN PRIDE POINTS!</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Not sure what Penmen Pride points are? You have earned these points this past semester by attending on campus events. At the end of the semester all points are tallied and the top 300 students with the highest point amounts will receive prizes just for attending on campus events! <b style="color: #152C59">The top 300 students will receive their prizes on Thursday, April 27th and Friday, April 28th.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #152C59; text-decoration: underline;; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Prize Pickup will begin in the Student Center Lobby at 9am on Thursday (4/27/17) until 3pm and recommence at 9am on Friday (4/28/17) until 3pm.</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To further explain prize eligibility, we have divided the winners into three specific tiers and have listed the prizes below. Tier 1 consists of the top 5 students with the largest amounts of points. Tier 2 consists of the top 50 students with the largest amounts of points. Finally, Tier 3 consists of the top 250 students with the largest amount of points. In addition, the student with the most points will additionally have their name engraved on a trophy in the Student Center.</p>
    <p style="color: #F3B329; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Currently your Tier status is: Ineligible: Senator</b></p>
